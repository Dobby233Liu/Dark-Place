## Installation
Those instructions are intended to those who only want to play Dark Place. If you want to contribute, see **Contributing** below.

<details><summary>Installing Kristal's dev version</summary>

Kristal is the engine Dark Place was made on. As such, you will need it to play.

For diverse reasons, the mod currently only runs on **0.8.1-dev** which is not a released version, you will need to install the source code version of Kristal which can easily be done with the CI builds.

Simply install [the latest build](https://nightly.link/KristalTeam/Kristal/workflows/ci/main/output.zip) and open the archive.

![Inside the CI archive](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755844178474303538/1143191651456655392/image.png)

If you are on Windows, you can simply extract the content of `kristal-0.8.1-dev-win.zip` in a folder anywhere you want on your computer and run the exe.

If you are on Linux or Mac, you'll have to install [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/) beforehand. After that, you can extract `kristal-0.8.1-dev.love` and run the love file.

</details>

<details><summary>Downloading Dark Place</summary>

After installing Kristal, download the latest version of Dark Place by clicking on the green button and then the "Download ZIP" one.

![The green "Code" button opens a menu where "Download ZIP" is available](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755844178474303538/1143194072148881479/image.png)

Once the download is done, open Kristal and look in the main menu for the option called "Open mods folder" and select it. It will open a folder where you will have to place **the content of the archive**.

!["Open mods folder" option in Kristal's menu](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755844178474303538/1143196297759826092/image.png)
![The content of the archive. The folder inside of the archive must be in the mods folder](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755844178474303538/1143196297537531995/image.png)

After that, you can start the mod as you would start any other Kristal mod by choosing "Play a mod" and select Dark Place.

> *Note: if for some reason it doesn't work and you are sure you did everything correctly, join the [Kristal Discord server](https://discord.gg/8ZGuKXJE2C) to ask for help.*
